# React Tic-Tac-Toe

Learned React through the [official Tic-Tac-Toe tutorial](https://react.dev/learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe).  
Check out the resulting game and my journey into React basics.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tmanso9/react-tic-tac-toe.git
   cd react-tic-tac-toe
   ```
2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. **Run the application:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
Open your browser and go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to play the Tic-Tac-Toe game.
 
## Project Overview

Throughout the tutorial, I covered essential React concepts, including:

- React Components (functional and class)
- State and Props management
- Event handling
- Conditional rendering
- State lifting
- Immutable data principles
- Functional Components and Hooks

## Project Structure

The project follows a standard React application structure:

- **src/App.js:** Main application component.
- **src/index.js:** Entry point for rendering the app.

Feel free to explore the code to understand how these concepts were implemented in the context of a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game.
